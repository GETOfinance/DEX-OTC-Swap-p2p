Decentralised Exchange with Yield farming and Staking, OTC Swap with Futures options using Crypto & Fiat and peer-to-peer exchange with local currencies.

Decentralized exchange (DEX)

Decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that facilitates automated and permissionless trading of various cryptocurrencies. It operates as a set of smart contracts, allowing users to trade tokens directly from their wallets without the need for a centralized intermediary.

Key features of DEX include:

Automated Market Making (AMM): DEX uses an automated market maker model, where liquidity is provided by users through liquidity pools rather than traditional order books. Liquidity providers deposit pairs of tokens into these pools, and the protocol uses a simple algorithm to determine the exchange rate based on the ratio of the two tokens in the pool.

Constant Product Formula: DEX employs a constant product formula, specifically x * y = k, where x and y represent the quantities of the two tokens in a liquidity pool, and k is a constant. This formula ensures that the product of the quantities remains the same, which determines the exchange rate.

Decentralized Liquidity: Liquidity providers are incentivized to deposit funds into DEX pools by earning fees on trades. These fees are distributed proportionally to the liquidity providers based on their share of the pool. Anyone can become a liquidity provider by depositing an equal value of both tokens in a specific pair.

Permissionless Listing: DEX allows for the permissionless listing of new tokens. Users can create a new pool for any ERC-20 token without needing approval from a centralized authority. This contributes to the platform's rapid expansion and the availability of a wide range of tokens.

Swap and Trade: Users can swap one token for another directly through the DEX interface. The exchange is executed instantly, and users receive the calculated amount of the desired token based on the current exchange rate.
D
ecentralized Governance: DEX protocol is governed by token holders, a native governance token of the DEX protocol, allowing holders to participate in decision-making processes and propose changes or improvements to the protocol.

Staking: Earning additional rewards for staking LP tokens. These rewards come in the form of native governance tokens, yield farming rewards, or other incentives. Users may stake their LP tokens in specific staking contracts to earn these additional rewards.

OTC Swap

OTC Swap is a peer-to-peer DEX with Futures options using Crypto & Fiat powered by Chainlink Functions.

Our protocol serves as a peer-to-peer marketplace for token trading, primarily targeting 'whales', or investors with large-scale holdings. These investors often encounter difficulties in liquidating their positions due to their substantial size. Our solution mitigates this issue by allowing whales to avoid 'sandwich attacks' on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), thereby facilitating smoother exits from their positions. This is particularly beneficial for those holding memecoins, which are typically illiquid and highly volatile. In addition, we've incorporated exotic financial instruments like options into our platform, offering a diversity of on-chain products that are currently less common in the market.
